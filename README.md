Presently simply shows an estimated depth stream from the OAK-D camera.

Look into the depthai and opencv APIs for programming info.

Can simply be run with `python3 main.py`.  If no camera is connected, the program will crash.

Other, more complicated sample programs with more fancy features are available.  We can look to those for inspiration if we wish.  https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments
