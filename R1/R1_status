Progress:
So far we have successfully implemented a wall detector, however the staircase detector still needs to be tested.
We have calculations in place to determine how we will be detecting staircases and other obtacles.

Calculations:
[Reference images/angle_calc.png]
Using some basic trigonometry math, we were able to calculate the maximum angle for the sensors when placed at the 30" specified by Dr. Leaman.
We were also able to create a formula for finding out the total distance ahead of the wheelchair that was visible when installed at a height X.

UI:
Although not originally planned, we have started the conceptualization of a UI design, and reference images can be seen in images/UI_[#].png
The current state of our UI is printing to the terminal when an alert is triggered.  This should be easily adjustable to some speaker library for an alert sound.
